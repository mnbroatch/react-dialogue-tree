- then without if
- double check 2 path long passive skill then 
- check active non skill checks still work

- explore DE for examples of going on a chain originating from a passive check and continuing with the passive check.

- double check continue button color at low pain threshold on first attempt
- missing branch at second attempt "grab your arm" (sibling)

- numbered choices

- red checks

- show passive check difficulty after result
- show active check modifiers

- general styling

- text at bottom (possible?)
- gaining items, exp, et cetera in dialogue (?)

- Tests
- Docs

Known Limitations:
  - Does not yet support active skill modifiers that cannot unlock white checks (ie, bonus from items).
  - Game state changing while in the middle of chain of passive skill checks will not affect subsequent checks in that chain.
  - A node arrived at from a passive check cannot branch (or even continue with a "next" node) without losing reference to the parent node (and one's place in the passive check chain).
  - No gold shop choices

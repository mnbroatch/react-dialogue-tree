This repo is using the PR here:

https://github.com/hylyh/bondage.js/pull/69

, which solves several issues including fixing conditional options, which are completely broken on the master branch.

It is included here because I can't trust a fork or a PR branch to continue existing, but if that change ever gets merged to master, that will not be necessary.

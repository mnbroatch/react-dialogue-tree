# React Dialogue Tree

What is it?
-----------


How do I install it in my own project?
----------------

`npm i -S react-dialogue-tree`


How do I run this project locally?
----------------

`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

The flag is needed per: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/12983

`npm start`


How do I use it?
----------------

```javascript
import DialogueTree from 'react-dialogue-tree'

const myDialogueTree = TODO
```



### Styling

For now, override css classes yourself.


#### Start somewhere other than "root"

If you want the dialogue to start on a node other than "root", TODO

This allows a consuming component to dynamically choose the starting position.
